Hark, gentle reader, who doth peruse these lines of encoded artifice!
Know ye that though thine eyes mayst wander o'er the characters therein inscribed,
and though thy mind mayst seek to unravel their intricate tapestry,
it is forbidden that thou shouldst meddle with the
very fabric of this digital creation.
For even I, the humble author, confess that the depths
of its operation remain shrouded in mystery, and the inner workings thereof are
veiled in a profound and perplexing obscurity, such that I myself am lost amidst
the labyrinthine pathways that lie beneath.
